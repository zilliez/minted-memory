# Yoyo NFT: Minted Memory Protocol

This is not a product. This is a blueprint.

Yoyo NFT modularizes lived artefacts—yo-yos, watches, spinners, voice fragments—into sovereign NFTs.  
Not hype. Not JPEG. Just memory minted for survival.

🧬 Phase: Alpha – Resonance Calibration in Progress  
🎯 Target: Polkadot Hackathon (Nov 2025)  
🔗 Repo: [github.com/zillez/yoyo-nft-protocol](https://github.com/zillez/yoyo-nft-protocol)

## Core Modules
- `docs/`: Audit manifesto, status, license
- `artefacts/`: Shelf visual, imprint notes, voice (optional)
- `contracts/`: Smart contract logic (`mintMemory`)
- `frontend/`: UI blueprint for minting and shelf display
- `ipfs/`: CID mapping for on-chain artefact earn

## Blueprint Logic
- Minting is sovereign, not crowd-driven
- Each artefact is a processor echo, not metadata
- CID links to lived experience, not speculation

## Submission Intent
This repo is a glitch-tier audit of what NFTs could be.  
If this existed, I’d hold on forever.
