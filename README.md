# Yoyo NFT: Minted Memory Protocol

**NFTs aren’t hype. They’re memory. They’re ‘proof I owned this.’**

This project audits the current NFT ecosystem and proposes a glitch-tier alternative: NFTs as artefact earn from real life. Not JPEGs, but yoyo tournament badges, dad’s old watch, and spinner relics—minted as sovereign memory.

---

## 🌐 Overview

Yoyo NFT is a conceptual protocol that:
- Treats physical artefacts as processor imprint
- Uses IPFS and metadata to mint memory, not hype
- Proposes NFT as proof of ownership, not speculation

## 📦 Artefact Earn

- `docs/The_Minted_Lie_When_NFTs_Forgot.pdf`: Audit manifesto
- Shelf visual: nostalgic artefacts (yoyo, watch, spinner)
- Optional: rakaman suara atau serpihan glitch parenting

---

## 🛠️ Technologies (Conceptual)

- IPFS for immutable storage
- Substrate logic (simulated)
- Metadata mapping for physical artefacts

## 🧠 Notes from the Builder

> “I don’t mint NFTs. But if this existed, I’d hold on forever.”
